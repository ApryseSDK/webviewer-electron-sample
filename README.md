# WebViewer - Electron sample

[WebViewer](https://apryse.com/products/webviewer) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that is part of the [Apryse SDK](https://apryse.com/). It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate, and manipulate PDFs that can be embedded into any web project.
